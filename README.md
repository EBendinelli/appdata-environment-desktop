# Privacy International's data interception environment
`Version: 2.0.3-20190129`

## Background
In December 2018, Privacy International released a report highlighting how Facebook can track you via Android apps even when your not a Facebook user. @F_Kaltheuner and @CJFWeatherhead presented the findings of this report at the 35th Chaos Computer Congress (35C3). Privacy International committed to releasing their environment used to conduct this research so as allow others to either repeat or expand on it.

Although the tools themselves are relatively trivial and there are already generic toolkits (such as Kali) that encompass them, this VM is specifically for one purpose, and includes documentation to assist with that purpose, hopefully negating some of the necessity to read forum posts or disparate documentation.

This is a replica of the original environment used to conduct the research, there are a number of reasons why the original environment was unsuitable for redistribution, principally potential issues around licensing due to the use of proprietary drivers. Additionally the original environment was devised in June 2018 and many of tools and features had been subsequently update, the updated software is present in this environment.
